# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of this SRS document is describes the software requirements for "Chemical.Labels".
Software that allows the user modify, create and print labels based on safety regulations within maquilas for the handling for chemicals. Adapting to the change of security regulations. Likewise it seeks to have a database that has the necessary information for the handling and use of chemical products as well as some other type of product that needs special handling.
Having thus two types of interface, the first one to generate the labels as required and the second one that has a library with all the risk products that are handled within the company, being an interface accessible to employees of different degrees.
## Scope
Chemical.Labels is a web-based which seeks to facilitate the handling of specific labels for the handling of chemicals, using a database to contain information on the regulations and chemicals that can be used within the maquila, as well as the specifications that must be included in the label according to the risk of handling or type of chemical. 

Using a database connected to an external server that will be updating information about the chemicals, the application will be installed inside the computers of the maquiladora in a local way, easy-to-use interface. The software needs internet conection for to update the information of news safety regulations as well as the information for new chemists that could have new functionalities within the way to treat in the safety of their handling. 

The software is exclusive for maquiladoras and companies that require the use of labels in their handling of chemical products with safety rules, seeks to obtain a database that beyond the generation of labels may have information of easy access to the handling of chemicals and other products with special management requirement.

## Overview
The rest of this document includes two other chapters as well as an appendix annex.
Â The next chapter will talk about the general description of the system as well as its functionality and perspective. The interaction between the interested parties and the interface of the system, the level required to use it and manage it efficiently. a review will be given to the rejections of the systems as well as the assumptions and dependencies, emphasizing in this last position that the level of the system will require the intervention of specified users that configure the system as required in case of updates in the use mode according to look like the company.
 
In the last chapter we will review the specified requirements, as well as a description of the different interfaces of the system, different techniques will be used to obtain the requirements in a more accurate way, adapting to the different users for which the software will be available, during the same Chapter will review the prioritization of the requirements. The appendices at the end of the document include all the results of the prioritization of requirements and a launching plan based on them.
